Open Source Access Management

When I joined my organisation I had to manually request access to resources via Slack DMs.
I didn't know whom should I contact, and when I knew, they forgot to grant me access or required approval of my seniors.
I wanted to solve this.

## Problems Solved -
1. The current practice of manually assigning platforms access requires manual attention and time to grant access.
2. Onboarding and marking exit of an employee requires requests to be raised at different platforms.
3. Securely managing access to cloud resources is an essential to ensure security of cloud resources.


Currently only supports access to Github repositories.

## Future works - 
Roles creation for admins.
User groups

## Add access to resources - 
Google Docs, Sheets, Slides
Remote Server access management
DB Access Management
